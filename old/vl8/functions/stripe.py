# What if some duration is "pretty short"?
#
# If one source is 60 minutes = 3600s and another is 1s, with
# a grain of 50ms, 2200 samples then if I scale that size down to the
# 1s source then it will be less than one sample long.
#
# A hard-limit on stripe size fixes this, but means we must expect to
# run out of some (short) sources before the end.
